    <p>Prior to the beginning of the game, Imperial soldiers catch the Dragonborn illegally crossing the border into Skyrim and mistake them for a Stormcloak rebel, a crime for which the player receives a death sentence. Along with the player, captured leader of the Stormcloak rebels, Ulfric Stormcloak is also preparing for execution. The execution of the player character by the Imperials in Helgen, a small settlement in Skyrim's south, is interrupted when Alduin suddenly appears and starts laying waste to the village. The player manages to escape through the tunnels underneath the keep, and heads to the nearby village of Riverwood, whose inhabitants ask the player to inform the Jarl of Whiterun, a large town to the north, of the dragon attack. After meeting with Jarl Balgruuf, and retrieving a tablet with information about the dragons from a nearby barrow on his behalf, the player kills a dragon which attacks nearby and absorbs its soul. After "shouting", the player is informed that they must be Dragonborn, and is soon summoned by the Greybeard monks. After a long journey and climb up the Throat of the World, the tallest mountain in Tamriel and home of the Greybeards, the Dragonborn is informed by Arngeir of their heritage and role in stopping Alduin, and begins their training.

        The Dragonborn is intercepted on one training quest by Delphine, a member of the order of the Blades, who in ancient times had served the Dragonborn. Delphine arranges for the Dragonborn to infiltrate the Thalmor Embassy to gain information; they learn that another member of the Blades, named Esbern, is in hiding in Riften. When Delphine and the Dragonborn find him, he reveals that the ancient Blades had carved a massive engraving in a temple in the Reach, an unstable region in Skyrim's west. This carving, called Alduin's Wall, depicted the dragon's defeat at the hands of the ancient Nords, and Esbern deciphers that those warriors had used a special shout to remove his ability to fly.
        
        The Dragonborn questions Arngeir, who reveals that the shout goes against the creeds of the Greybeards. He directs the Dragonborn to Paarthurnax, who lives on the summit of the Throat, to better conceal his existence. Paarthurnax reveals that although neither he nor anyone else knows the shout, Alduin's defeat through the power of an Elder Scroll had left a gash in time, and theorizes that reading a Scroll would allow the Dragonborn to look through time and learn the shout from those who created it. Having delved into a massive Dwemer city called Blackreach, far below the ground, the Dragonborn retrieves the Scroll and reads it on the Throat, the site of the ancient battle. Alduin arrives and fights with Paarthurnax and the Dragonborn, who has learned the shout and overpowers Alduin, who flees.

        The Dragonborn learns from Esbern how to summon a dragon named Odahviing, whom they trap in Whiterun with Jarl Balgruuf's assistance. Odahviing, believing that the Dragonborn is mightier than Alduin, turns on his former leader and reveals that he has gone to recover his strength in Sovngarde, the Nordic afterlife, where he feeds on the souls of the dead. Since the portal to Sovngarde cannot be reached on foot, Odahviing bargains his freedom in exchange for flying the Dragonborn there. Entering Sovngarde, the Dragonborn meets the three heroes who had defeated Alduin originally; with their help, the Dragonborn kills Alduin, though the living dragons still remain across Skyrim for the Dragonborn to defeat.</p>
