        <p>Freedom and creativity are often aspects of gameplay that players like. It lets them experience the game's world in a way they want. That's one of the major strengths of Skyrim over other major gaming titles, like The Witcher 3 for instance. There's no default character. The Dragonborn can be anyone.

            After character creation, the choice of one's skills and character build is also incredibly flexible. You can pick and choose freely from a large skill tree with powerful perks. There's no right way to do things, and that's why Skyrim wins over other games, because players keep on coming back and starting over to experience it all from a different perspective.

            The open-world genre has been present for years, and existed well before Skyrim's arrival to store shelves. However, Skyrim really revolutionized the idea of a world that could be explored freely, and with loading screens introduced only when accessing indoor areas or sub-locations.

The vast, gorgeous plains and mountains of Skyrim, all freely available for players to explore, create a sense of freedom and excitement almost no other game has been able to replicate. Even better, a horse can climb almost any cliff, a feature which was definitely meant to be there from the start.

Deserves It More: Minecraft Is The Defining Survival Crafting Game
Minecraft Player On A Pig
Although Skyrim has seen a release on almost every platform, it remains a game that still needs quite the system to run it. It's not without its bugs and complications, and years after, there haven't been any major changes or DLCs from Bethesda to make the game feel fresh and interesting.

The same can't be said from Minecraft, which has retained a steady and huge player base for years. Despite a simple concept, it's a game that can be run on almost any PC and console (even VR), and even has an educational version. Mojang has been extremely proactive with listening to fans and the community, which has made it into a game largely shaped by the opinions of fans. The best part? It still holds up today, and will most likely continue into the future, which is what drastically sets it apart from a game like Skyrim, that might just be pushed aside by The Elder Scrolls 6.

it is also a good game cause of its modding community making you be able to do things like control the dragon get a plane etc.
